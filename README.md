# Amap
The following are the  alanine and general AMAP grid like corrections. Format is Amber-like for ease of use (24*24 grid), expanding along  Ï† from left (starting at -180) to right.  Values are in Kcal/mol.
There is a file for the fix applied to alanine and one for the rest of amino acids (excluding Glycine and proline, which have no fix).
